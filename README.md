# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They've changed a lot over time and will likely change a lot more over time.

If you're looking at them and you're not me, feel free to use them as a guide.

# Setup

- Clone dotfiles:

  ```console
      mkdir -p $HOME/src/gitlab.com/chaseadamsio
      git clone git@gitlab.com:chaseadamsio/dotfiles.git
  ```

- Symlink files

- Install homebrew:

  ```console
  #!/bin/bash
  homebrew_expected_md5="546219756e1bc7a557030d9e63d2d6f0"
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install -o /tmp/homebrew.sh
  homebrew_downloaded_md5="$(cat /tmp/homebrew.sh | md5 | awk '{print $1}')"
  if [ "$homebrew_expected_md5" != "$homebrew_downloaded_md5" ]; then
      echo "md5 for expected homebrew install script does not match downloaded homebrew install script, exiting."
      exit 1
  fi

  /usr/bin/ruby -e /tmp/homebrew.sh
  exit 0
  ```

## Set Shell

- run `brew bundle`

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
