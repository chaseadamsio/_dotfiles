# nvim config

[Install](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
```

Run `make init` from the root. If you don't run `make init` before opening
`nvim`, it will generate a `custom` directory which is what's all stored in this
`nvim` directory.

`custom` is added to the `.config/nvim/lua` directory via a make script.

Run anywhere:

```bash
nvim
```
